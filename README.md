# World Population Data Scraper and Analyzer

This repository contains a Python script that uses web scraping techniques to extract population data from the Worldometer website. The script fetches the latest population statistics by country and stores the information in a tabular format using the Pandas library. The collected data can be saved in both CSV and Excel file formats for further analysis.

# Project Overview:
The World Population Data Scraper is a simple yet powerful tool for collecting and analyzing global population statistics. The script performs the following tasks:

Web Scraping: Utilizes the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to fetch data from the Worldometer website.

Data Extraction: Parses the HTML content to extract country names, population data, yearly changes, net changes, land area, fertility rates, and median ages.

Data Analysis: Organizes the extracted data into a Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and analysis.

Data Storage: Saves the collected data in both CSV and Excel formats for convenient storage and sharing.

# How to Use:
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/world-population-scraper.git
